2D sidescroller platform game similar to original Super Mario series.

Written in Lua using Love2D. The game is still in development, but now it's playable and nearly everything from game mechanics is implemented. Also the game consist of editor. When it's all finished, I will release a brief introduction how to use it and also, it will be available for mobile phones (main purpose) - game about polandball, yay!

Yeah and the graphics is product of mine as well...
